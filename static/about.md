Ever since I was a child I have loved mathematics.
Solving equations and understanding the process has always been fun for me. Why does this work? How did this mathematician 
solve this? How was this equation created? Not knowing would only make me think about it more. 
As I learned more my questions only grew. When I finally learned calculus many of my questions were answered. 
That is when I knew I wanted to continue learning mathematics for the rest of my life.


I am currently studying at Southern Utah University and have also attended 3 semesters at Utah State University
I am majoring in mathematics with a minor in computer science.
My goal is to continue studying mathematics and study artificial intelligence after graduation. 
I am also interested in computer security, programming, cyberpunk, stencil art, drawing, choice theory, and philosophy.
